 Repository with every resource made and used in Abendiix's social media posts.

### Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to explain and show openly the templates used for Abendiix's social media posts. All the resources are licensed under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/) and everyone is free to use them as they want and make with them anything they please.

### Explanation
These templates are designed to differentiate and categorize every post to improve the users' experience. With this system anyone can quickly recognize what kind of information will be shared on the posts and what should they expect from them.

Given how social media platforms work as of today, this categorizing system capitalizes on hashtags as well as on the grid-view system that most of these platforms use to preview every user's posts, offering users the possibility of avoiding spoilers by muting/blocking related hashtags, avoiding opening posts they are not keen on or even facilitating the search for posts that interesest them. 

This way of making social media posts is not typical and may not work as well as other type of posts when it comes to algorithms or engagement, but the goal is to make social media posts as healthy as possible, avoiding the negative impacts that social media may cause to mental health by having a well organized feed with nicely categorized posts.

With all of this taken into consideration, the aim is to post on as much social media plaftorms as possible to not force anyone to make an account on a platform that they do not want to be part of. To go even further, I prepared an RSS for people that prefer this method and to avoid leaving my way of communicating any news or information with people to a platform in which I do not have any control and that cannot assure me when it may end its services. The RSS file can be accessed at [abendiix.com/rss.xml](https://abendiix.com/rss.xml)

The 4 posts' categories and their symbols are:
Release - Release posts will refer to any release/launch of any game, tool, project or anything similar. 
Preview - Preview posts will refer to anything related to Abendiix's project to showcase elements, parts, information and much more about those projects.
Update - Update posts will refer to any change made to Abendiix's project. Updates may go from small changes like adding a functionality to a website to bigger changes or updates such as a completely new version of a game.
Extra - Extra posts will refer to anything not covered in the previous categories. Extra posts may cover special events, celebrating something, communicating something the previous categories do not cover and more.

### How
The templates where designed taking into account what are the best sizes and ratios for each social media platform as well as optimizing them for the different grid-view systems. The concepts where first made with [Aseprite](https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite) and when everything looked just as I wanted, I animated it on Aseprite to then export each frame and adapt its design with [Inkscape](https://github.com/inkscape/inkscape) to soften some of the pixels on the designs and to vectorize the design. This was done to reduce the feeling of mixels (the use of different "size of pixels") when showcasing pixel art games, to improve the readability of the categories and to give it a more distinct look.

When every frame for every category was finished, I imported them onto [Kdenlive](https://github.com/KDE/kdenlive) to set up a common template file for each category and size. Each category has an "S" (for square) size and a "V" (for vertical) size. The use of the different sizes will depend on what is best for each platform and the showcased content will be the same on every platform.
